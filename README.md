# What is it?

This is a side effect, for now. Don't waste time looking at it.

I was curious about how much better C++11 is than the C++ I've used. There
is/was much scope for improvement. So I rewrote something from another
language in C++.

I'll complete it... maybe. If I do I'll write a blog post about it and fix
this README. If I don't or until I do, you may safely assume that this
isn't interesting to you. It has taught me about move operators and TR1,
it doesn't need to do more.
