# What is it?

This is an experiment, for now. Don't waste time looking at it.

I was curious about how much better C++11 is than the C++ I've used. There
is/was much scope for improvement. So I rewrote something in C++. I'll
complete it, maybe. If I do I'll write a blog post about it and fix this
README. If I don't, you may safely assume that this isn't interesting to
you.
